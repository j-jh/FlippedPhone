# FlippedPhone
--- 

Everyone told me it wouldn't be possible, that it would be a bad idea. That's exactly why I built it anyway. Introducing the React + Next.js web app that makes dialing random phone numbers possible: FlippedPhone.

Why should we limit ourselves to the people in our contacts? I’m here to present a tool for motivated individuals to network outside of their immediate circle.

> **Warning:** *Functional calling with Twilio only works in local deployment, and must only be used on authorized, consented phone numbers.*
